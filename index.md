# Ayush's AI Knowledge Graph

Personal knowledge base for AI product building, learning, and decision-making.
Claude: read this index first, then follow relevant topic links based on the current task.

## Topic Maps
- [[future-of-ai-business]] — how businesses will be created/run in the AI age, what's coming
- [[ai-native-product-architecture]] — database, search, context graphs, RAG, system design
- [[ai-agents]] — autonomous systems, tool use, multi-agent, agent frameworks
- [[ai-coding-tools]] — Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, leveraging AI to build faster
- [[knowledge-systems]] — context engineering, skill graphs, second brains, memory
- [[business-models]] — AI-native SaaS, pricing, GTM, revenue models

## Cross-Domain Insights
- [[context-is-the-product-not-the-model]] — spans architecture, business models, knowledge systems

Shipper identifies a social mechanism for agent adoption: trust is first earned by the agent through daily performance with its operator, then transfers socially to colleagues through the operator's credibility. When colleagues see that your agent handles tasks reliably, they start depending on it — inheriting trust from you. This mirrors how [[agents-become-the-buyer]] works at the organizational level, but at the interpersonal level.

This has implications for [[saas-survives-as-governance-and-coordination-layer]] — if agent trust flows through human relationships, governance systems need to track not just what agents do but who operates them. It also connects to [[agent-memory-preserves-institutional-knowledge]] because the trust chain depends on the agent having a consistent track record, which requires persistent memory of past performance.

Bustamante doesn't log into any of his SaaS anymore — his agent does. He runs Fintool with 6 people handling more than 100+ people did at his previous company. "I'm replacing payroll with tokens."

The shift from B2B to B2A (Business to Agent) changes what matters: VPs evaluating UX get replaced by agents evaluating API quality. Onboarding gives way to latency and documentation. The agent recommends, the human approves. The cross-system context merging becomes the power move — headless isn't about avoiding dashboards, it's about merging context from sources never designed to talk to each other. Standards like [[webmcp-turns-websites-into-agent-native-interfaces]] make this practical: instead of agents scraping and guessing, websites declare their capabilities as structured tools.

This is the demand-side driver of why [[ui-moat-collapses-api-becomes-purchasing-criterion]]. For per-seat pricing, it's existential — agents don't need seats. Combined with [[middleware-dies-infrastructure-survives]], the SaaS companies most at risk are those whose value was primarily UI and workflow convenience.

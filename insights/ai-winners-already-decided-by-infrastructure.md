The gold rush metaphor is a lie. In 1849, anyone could pan for gold. In the 1990s internet, barriers were low and thousands built real businesses. In 2020s AI, infrastructure is already owned. NVIDIA controls the silicon (70%+ gross margins, no competitors at scale), hyperscalers meter compute, foundation labs hold the weights behind API tolls, and data monopolies control proprietary corpora.

The difference is structural: engineered scarcity, black-box opacity, capital velocity, labor compression, and geopolitical stakes. The narrow paths that do exist: vertical integration plays (data + distribution + domain trust), proprietary feedback loops, infra tools for the infra layer (evals, observability), edge deployment, and non-consensus data plays.

The litmus test: if your product lost the "AI" label tomorrow, would customers still pay? This connects to [[middleware-dies-infrastructure-survives]] — the same logic that kills middleware also explains why startups without hard assets face structural headwinds. And it tempers the optimism of [[implementation-gap-collapsed]] — building is easier, but building something defensible is harder than ever. Yet Sinofsky's [[technology-transitions-create-more-not-less]] suggests more total opportunity will emerge even as the structure consolidates — the question isn't whether there's gold, but where it pools.

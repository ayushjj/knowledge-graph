A structured 30-day AI mastery roadmap follows a progression from prompting through data to applications. But mapping a real builder's journey against the same roadmap revealed they'd already mastered context engineering, AI-assisted coding, and RAG fundamentals — not through study, but through solving real deployment problems, writing specs, and debugging integration issues on a production system serving 700 people.

This is the experiential version of what [[compound-engineering-makes-future-work-easier]] describes systematically: each real problem solved compounds into intuition that no curriculum can replicate. The builder learned context engineering by isolating Railway debugging from other work, not by reading about the four strategies (write, select, compress, isolate). They learned [[specs-are-external-memory-surviving-context-resets]] by needing spec files to survive context resets during multi-session debugging, not by studying best practices. The implication for AI-native education: provide scaffolded real projects, not structured lessons. This is the experiential case for why [[dont-be-the-discriminator-be-the-patron]] — building in friction with the tool (patron) teaches more than selecting from AI output (discriminator).

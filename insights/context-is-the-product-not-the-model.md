The model is not your product. The experience around the model is your product. Anyone can call Claude or GPT — the API is the same for everyone. Your differentiation is the data you have access to, the skills you've built, the UX you've designed, the reliability you've engineered, and how well you know the industry.

The real work isn't prompting — it's turning messy data into clean, structured context the model can use. Everything becomes markdown (narrative), CSV (structured data), or JSON metadata (searchable). This connects directly to why [[files-are-the-universal-agent-interface]] — when context is your moat, you need formats that both agents and humans can work with.

This is also why [[decision-traces-are-the-missing-data-layer]] represents a trillion-dollar opportunity — the "why" behind decisions is the highest-value context, and no one captures it systematically yet. The companies that own [[skills-as-markdown-replace-fine-tuning]] also own the context layer.

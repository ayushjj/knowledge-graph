The gap between "idea" and "working system" — once filled by technical knowledge and hours of building — collapsed to "one paragraph of English, working system in minutes." That gap was what the entire $47B automation consulting industry sold. It's gone.

The AI is as good as your ability to describe what you want. This is a communication skill, not a technical skill. Alton Syn's agency went from 15 employees to 5, still doing $600K/month, delivering projects in 3 days instead of 3 weeks. The smart consultants pivoted from "I'll build it for you" to "I'll help you figure out what to build" — from implementation to strategy.

This is why [[technical-knowledge-becomes-liability]] in certain contexts, and connects to Karpathy's observation that [[declarative-beats-imperative-for-agents]] — the skill shifts from instructing to specifying. And as [[building-beats-following-for-ai-mastery]] shows, this new clarity develops through building real projects, not following structured curricula — the best way to learn AI-assisted development is to ship.

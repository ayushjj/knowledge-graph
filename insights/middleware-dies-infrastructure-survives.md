In 2026, we pay for assets, not wrappers. Middleware — companies selling an "easy button" for technical chores — dies because AI made those hard things trivial. PaaS markup (Heroku, Render, Vercel), drag-and-drop builders (Framer), custom monitors, and dashboards (Metabase) are all replaceable.

What survives: physical infrastructure (AWS, Cloudflare — you can't AI your way to a server farm), expert judgment (legal, tax — high-stakes decisions need humans), and tools that are genuinely good at hard problems (Linear, Sentry, Postmark). The survival framework is simple: expert infrastructure stays, expert judgment stays, middleware and wrappers go.

This connects to [[ai-winners-already-decided-by-infrastructure]] — the same structural forces that protect AWS protect any company whose value is in hard-to-replicate assets rather than software convenience. It's also why [[ui-moat-collapses-api-becomes-purchasing-criterion]] — if the only differentiation was a nice dashboard, agents don't care. The [[open-source-captures-value-through-services-not-software]] pattern shows this isn't new — open source commoditized the software layer decades ago, and the companies that thrived sold infrastructure and services around the free code.

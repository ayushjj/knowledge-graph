The thesis: in an AI world, we pay for assets, not wrappers. Middleware — companies selling an "easy button" for technical chores — faces existential pressure because AI makes those hard things trivial. PaaS markup, drag-and-drop builders, custom monitors, and dashboards are all increasingly replaceable when agents can generate equivalent functionality.

What survives: physical infrastructure (you can't AI your way to a server farm), expert judgment (legal, tax — high-stakes decisions need humans), and tools that are genuinely good at hard problems. The survival framework: expert infrastructure stays, expert judgment stays, middleware and wrappers face compression.

This connects to [[ai-winners-already-decided-by-infrastructure]] — the same structural forces that protect hard-to-replicate assets protect any company whose value is in infrastructure rather than software convenience. It's also why [[ui-moat-collapses-api-becomes-purchasing-criterion]] — if the only differentiation was a nice dashboard, agents don't care. The [[open-source-captures-value-through-services-not-software]] pattern shows this isn't new — open source commoditized the software layer decades ago, and the companies that thrived sold infrastructure and services around the free code.

> **Note**: This insight was originally attributed to "@MylesMarino1 — 2025 Vendor Audit" but the source tweet/thread could not be located during a February 2026 audit. Specific company examples (Heroku, Render, Vercel, Framer, Metabase, Linear, Sentry, Postmark) were removed as they could not be verified against the original source. The general thesis is widely discussed in AI business discourse.

Aravind Srinivas reframes what a "computer" is. The next evolution of computing isn't a better model — it's the orchestration system that conducts many models into a unified intelligence. Perplexity launched a massively multimodel product: 19 backend models functioning as a single agent system, capable of delegating tasks, managing files, executing code, and browsing the web within a secure sandbox.

"No one model family can do its best work for you without the talents of others." Just as a conductor arranges musicians' talents, AI systems must coordinate specialized models. The differentiation isn't individual models but "how you orchestrate them." This extends [[multi-model-ensemble-catches-single-model-blindspots]] from code review to the entire product: models with different strengths and failure modes create emergent capability that none achieves alone.

Srinivas argues this solves the internet's READ problem: "when AI can find, analyze, reason, and accurately present all knowledge on the open web, the READ problem is finally solved." The orchestration layer is what makes this possible — no single model can find, analyze, reason, AND present. Different models handle different parts of the pipeline.

He traces computing from human "computers" (astronomers doing math by hand) through mechanical, digital, and GUI interfaces. Each evolution returned autonomy to machines, freeing humans from watching interfaces. AI as orchestration system is the next step — the computer handles multi-step reasoning autonomously. This is [[orchestrator-agent-replaces-human-coordination]] at the infrastructure level: the meta-agent isn't just managing sub-agents, it's managing sub-*models* as a unified system.

With new frontier models arriving every ~17 days in 2025, the symphony expands continuously. This is why [[production-agents-route-decisions-not-every-call-to-llm]] matters more than ever — as the model zoo grows, deterministic routing becomes core infrastructure. And it vindicates [[treat-ai-like-distributed-team-not-assistant]]: 19 models working as a team outperform any single genius model working alone.

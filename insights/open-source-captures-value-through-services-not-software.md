The counterintuitive pattern of open source economics: giving away the software creates more value than selling it. Red Hat was acquired for $34 billion, GitHub for $7.5 billion, Docker valued at $2 billion — all built on free software. Four distinct models emerge: corporate sponsors who need the tool (Linux), paid services layers on top of free engines (Docker Enterprise), support and training ecosystems (Git → GitHub), and cloud strategy where the free tool is a funnel to paid infrastructure (TensorFlow → Google Cloud).

This directly reinforces [[middleware-dies-infrastructure-survives]] — the software layer commoditizes while the infrastructure and services layers capture value. It also connects to [[saas-survives-as-governance-and-coordination-layer]] because what companies actually pay for is management dashboards, security scanning, support, and governance — the coordination layer around the free tool. The pattern maps to AI-native business: open-source models commoditize while [[context-is-the-product-not-the-model]] because the differentiation is in what you build around the model, not the model itself.

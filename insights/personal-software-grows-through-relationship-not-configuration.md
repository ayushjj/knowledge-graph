Dan Shipper frames personal software not as customizable apps but as agents that evolve a personality in response to you. This is a step beyond [[malleable-software-writes-its-own-extensions]] — the software doesn't just extend itself, it develops a relationship. The user doesn't configure settings; they guide an agent through interaction, and the agent adapts its strengths and preferences over time.

This reframes the product design question entirely. Instead of asking "what features should we build?", the question becomes "what kind of relationship should the agent develop with its user?" — connecting directly to [[features-are-prompts-not-code]] where the feature IS the agent's learned behavior, not shipped code. It also implies that [[context-is-the-product-not-the-model]] extends to personal context — the agent's accumulated understanding of one specific human becomes the moat.

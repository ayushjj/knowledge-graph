title: "AI won't destroy SaaS moats — it'll make the biggest ones even bigger"
description: "Enterprise SaaS consolidates rather than fragments: we could see 5-10 individual trillion-dollar SaaS companies. Moats are people, relationships, and enterprise integrations — not code. Cheaper AI-built software doesn't overcome distribution advantages."

The "SaaSpocalypse" narrative says AI makes software so cheap to build that SaaS incumbents die. Konstantine Buhler's counter: AI is a work revolution, not a communication revolution. Work revolutions (like the PC/Excel shift) give new tools but don't change distribution. Communication revolutions (like the internet) change distribution entirely. Since AI doesn't change who has enterprise relationships, incumbents keep their distribution advantage.

The evidence: Freshworks was founded in Chennai with a 7x cost advantage ($10K/year devs vs $70K+ in the US). Yet Freshworks is a $4.5B company while ServiceNow is $200B. Cheaper software development — even dramatically cheaper — does not overcome deep enterprise moats. The same logic applies to AI-generated software.

Buhler projects we could see "five or ten trillion-dollar enterprise SaaS businesses" — individual companies at $1T+ market cap, concentrated like the Magnificent Seven in tech. The winners: ServiceNow, Palantir, Palo Alto Networks — companies entrenched in large enterprises with decades of integrations. "The biggest moats at the biggest enterprise companies are not software moats, they are people moats; they are relationships with the C-suite."

This follows the pattern from [[technology-transitions-create-more-not-less]]: Oracle grew alongside Salesforce during the SaaS transition. Both old and new expanded. AI will do the same — the market grows but concentrates upward toward platform winners, consistent with [[ai-winners-already-decided-by-infrastructure]].

Separately, Buhler frames AI's real opportunity as the $10T US services market (labor budgets, not existing software spend). Cloud expanded software from $350B to $650B+. AI targets the much larger labor pool. This resolves the tension between [[middleware-dies-infrastructure-survives]] and [[saas-survives-as-governance-and-coordination-layer]]: middleware SaaS dies, but platform SaaS that provides governance and deep enterprise workflows absorbs that value and grows.

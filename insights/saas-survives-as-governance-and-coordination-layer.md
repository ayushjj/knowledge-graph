The "SaaS is dead" narrative misses something structural: when a non-deterministic process (AI/LLM) feeds into a deterministic one (database, approval workflow), the entire system is governed by the deterministic layer. Boards won't accept AI-generated forecasts the VP Sales can't explain. SaaS is essentially a system of governance and accountability.

The deeper point is that the core value of SaaS was never individual productivity — it was coordination. Org hierarchies, access control, workflow approvals, audit trails. None of that goes away when [[agents-become-the-buyer]]. If anything, agents need *more* governance structure, not less — which is why [[production-agents-route-decisions-not-every-call-to-llm]], routing routine cases through deterministic rules and reserving the LLM for genuine ambiguity. This is the strongest counterargument to [[middleware-dies-infrastructure-survives]] — the middleware that embeds coordination and accountability logic isn't middleware at all, it's infrastructure.

What does change: unused seats get negotiated into AI credits, seat-based pricing shifts to usage-based, and being locked to one model provider becomes irresponsible since a game-changing new LLM drops every few months. The companies with data and workflow gravity survive; the ones selling UI convenience don't. This nuance matters for [[context-is-the-product-not-the-model]] — SaaS platforms that own the coordination context have a durable moat even in an agent-native world.

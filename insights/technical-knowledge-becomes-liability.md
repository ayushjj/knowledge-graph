The expert approaches every problem thinking "how would I build this?" — gets stuck on implementation details, spends hours on things AI handles automatically. The novice describes the outcome they want, lets the agent figure out implementation, and ships in minutes. The expert is debugging while the novice is delivering.

This is the counterintuitive implication of the [[implementation-gap-collapsed]]. It doesn't mean technical knowledge is useless — it means the reflex to think in implementation terms actively slows you down. The shift Karpathy describes in [[declarative-beats-imperative-for-agents]] is the same insight from the engineering side: stop telling, start specifying.

Karpathy himself noted his manual coding ability is already atrophying, and predicted a split in engineers: builders will thrive, pure coders may struggle.

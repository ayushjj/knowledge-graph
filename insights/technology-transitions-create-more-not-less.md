description: "Every predicted death — mainframes, physical retail, traditional media — resulted in growth of both old and new; AI will create more software, not less"

PCs were supposed to kill mainframes — both grew massively. Amazon was supposed to kill physical retail — both Amazon and Walmart became trillion-dollar companies. Digital was supposed to kill traditional media — there's vastly more media today. The pattern repeats: old thing grows larger, new thing adds to ecosystem, transition takes a generation (not five years), and there are multiple winners.

Sinofsky argues AI will follow the same pattern: more software than ever (we're nowhere near meeting demand), AI moves up the stack as part of everything, domain expertise becomes more important not less. Nader Dabit provides the mechanism: [[software-abundance-unlocks-categories-that-never-existed]] because software has always been more expensive than we can afford to build, and when costs drop 10-20x, the [[implementation-gap-collapsed]] at the individual level scales to the entire industry.

The timeline tension is real: Shumer and Dabit say it's happening NOW, Sinofsky says transitions take a generation. Both are right — capability is here, but adoption is uneven. This matters for [[middleware-dies-infrastructure-survives]] — the middleware isn't dead yet, but the direction is clear.

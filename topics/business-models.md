# Business Models

AI-native SaaS, pricing strategies, go-to-market, revenue models, and how value capture changes with AI.

## Key Themes

### The SaaS Compression
UI moats collapse, per-seat pricing dies, margins compress from Salesforce-level to Twilio-level. API quality becomes the primary purchasing criterion.

### Defensibility Shifts
Proprietary data, domain expertise, infrastructure ownership, and expert judgment are durable moats. Wrappers, dashboards, and convenience features are not.

### The SaaS Counterargument
Not all SaaS dies. Governance, coordination, and accountability layers are structural — enterprises need audit trails, access control, and deterministic workflows even (especially) when AI is non-deterministic. Data + workflow gravity protects incumbents.

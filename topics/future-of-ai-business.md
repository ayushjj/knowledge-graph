# Future of AI Business

How businesses will be created and run in the AI age — what's coming, what shifts, what becomes possible.

## Key Themes

### The Great Rebalancing
Implementation becomes cheap, strategy becomes expensive. Technical skill matters less than clarity of specification. Middleware dies while infrastructure endures.

### More, Not Less
Technology transitions historically create more of the "dying" thing. AI will create more software, more businesses, more opportunity — but the distribution of who captures value shifts dramatically.

### Power Consolidation
AI's opportunity structure is pre-consolidated. Infrastructure owners, data monopolies, and foundation labs hold structural advantages unlike any previous tech wave.

### Accelerating Timelines
AI's self-improvement loop compresses everything — each generation builds the next faster. Software abundance, job displacement, and model obsolescence all happen on an accelerating curve, not a linear one.

# Knowledge Systems

Context engineering, skill graphs, second brains, memory architectures, and how to structure knowledge for humans and agents.

## Key Themes

### Memory as Infrastructure
Agent memory files and decision logs create institutional knowledge that outlives individuals. This is context engineering made operational.

### Knowledge That Compounds
Compound engineering, spec-first development, and cross-user knowledge transfer all share a pattern: structured capture of what was learned during work, not after it.

### Progressive Disclosure Over Flat Search
Complex domains need interconnected knowledge that agents navigate progressively — index → description → links → sections → full content. Skill graphs, knowledge graphs, and PageIndex all use this pattern.

## Insights
- [[agent-memory-preserves-institutional-knowledge]] — Persistent memory files outlive employee turnover
- [[files-are-the-universal-agent-interface]] — Plain files as the shared substrate between human and agent knowledge
- [[dont-be-the-discriminator-be-the-patron]] — The human role is co-creation through friction, not curation of output
- [[compound-engineering-makes-future-work-easier]] — Review-phase learning extraction is the compounding mechanism
- [[specs-are-external-memory-surviving-context-resets]] — Spec files bridge intent across sessions
- [[cross-user-knowledge-transfer-needs-no-fine-tuning]] — One user's learning benefits others automatically
- [[structure-plus-reasoning-beats-flat-similarity]] — Structured knowledge navigated by reasoning outperforms flat indexes searched by similarity
- [[skill-graphs-enable-progressive-disclosure]] — Single skill files hit a ceiling; complex domains need interconnected navigable knowledge
- [[embeddings-measure-similarity-not-truth]] — Vector search can't resolve contradictions or understand time; similarity ≠ truth
- [[evolving-summaries-beat-append-only-memory]] — Rewriting profiles instead of appending handles contradictions naturally
- [[treat-agent-as-operating-system-not-function]] — RAM (context), hard drive (memory), garbage collection (decay), I/O (tools)
- [[tiered-retrieval-prevents-context-overload]] — Summaries first, details on demand keeps retrieval within token budgets
- [[building-beats-following-for-ai-mastery]] — Real projects teach AI skills faster than structured curricula
- [[session-capture-compounds-development-knowledge]] — shadcn's /done pattern turns ephemeral sessions into compounding knowledge
